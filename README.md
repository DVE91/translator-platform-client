:eyes: [You can find the deployed version of this project here](https://naughty-lumiere-bdfc94.netlify.app/) :eyes:

Sometimes you need a translation that takes into account specific culture references, or needs to convey a certain sentiment to its reader.
To avoid embarrassing mistakes, you need someone that can transcreate, not just translate, communications aligned with your brand. 

Tone of Choice is a translation booking platform that celebrate :sparkles: artists of transcreation. :sparkles:
It provides a quick and easy order system for translations, and a nice dashboard with interesting features for translators associated to the platform.

#### Goals, userstories and wireframe

##### Goals :pencil2:
This project drew its inspiration from a friend, who works as a freelance translator and has a true passion for language.
As a freelancer, she manages her work in two ways:
1. Through a large known translation platform => high traffic, mostly anonymous, "who writes it" is not a priority.
2. Through her personal website => low traffic, very personal, clients seek her for her work and style.

Her experience with both of these media, led to the following userstories.
The goal was to make a platform that is "best of both worlds". Make it easy for a client to book a translation, 
put the translator back in the spotlights where they belong. 

##### Userstories :pencil2:
1. As a customer in need of translation, I want to see which translators are available for my assignment, that match the criteria of the job.
2. As a customer in need of translation, I want to receive a realtime quote, so I can book said job straight away.
3. As a customer, I want to receive my order on or before the assigned deadline by e-mail.
4. As a translator, I want to be able to work on my assignments on the platform, so I can send it back to my client upon completion. 
5. As a translator, I want to have an overview of my jobs, my availability, my personal profile and my finances.
6. As a translator, I want to be able to uphold my own calendar and set my own fee, so I can be in control of my availability and my rates.
